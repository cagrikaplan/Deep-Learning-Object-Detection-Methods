Research question: How a multiscale and sliding window approach can be efficiently implemented witin a ConvNet?

Contribution: Localization by learning to predict object boundaries. Bounding boxes are then accumulated rather than
suppressed to increase detection confidence. Different tasks can be learned simultaneously using a single shared network.

Images in ImageNet dataset contains centered object fills much of the image size. In real world, generally object of 
interest vary significantly in size and position within the image.

Possible solutions:
1. Apply convnet at multiple locations in the image in sliding window fashion over multiple scales. 
2. Train the system to produce a prediction of the location and size of the bounding box containing the object relative 
to the window.
3. Accumulate the evidence for each category at each location and size.
