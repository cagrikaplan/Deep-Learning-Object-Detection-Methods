Works without proposal algorithms.

Overall algorithm: Superimpose a multi-scale regular grid on the image. The boxes can overlap. Assign each box to a ground
truth (IoU) during the training. Then regress boxes in the grid to move towards the objects in the image they are assigned to.

Network: Base model can be either AlexNet or VGG. After conv layers, a ROI pooling layer is added as well. After the fc layers,
a linear regressor outputs the change in the location and scale of each current bounding box.
