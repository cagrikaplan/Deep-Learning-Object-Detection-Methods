Motivation: Prior works repurposes classifiers for detection. Instead, purpose regression on spatially separated bounding
boxes and associated class probabilities. Notice that the whole detection pipeline is a single network which allows to 
optimize it end-to-end directly.

Main difference from the previous works: YOLO sees the entire image during training and test time so it implicitly encodes
contextual information about classes as well as their appearances.

How YOLO works?
Divide the input image into SxS grid. (S=7 for PASCAL VOC with 20 classes)
Each grid cell predicts B bounding boxes (bb) and confidence score. (B=2 for PASCAL VOC and confidence score is IoU between
predicted bounding box and ground truth)
For each bb, there are five predictions (x, y, w, h, confidence). 
Thus, for each grid cell, 2 bb each has 5 predictions (overall 10) and 20 of classes, length of the tensor is 30. For S=7,
whole tensor is 7x7x30.
Predict also the class propobabilities per grid cell regardless of the B.
At test time, multiply class prob and box confidence predictions which gives class-specpfpc confidence scores for each box.

Training
Pre-trained convnet on ImageNet 1000 class dataset.
Then to improve detection, conv and fully connected layers with random parameters are added.
Detection requires fine-grained visual information; increase the input resolution from 224x224 to 448x448.
Final layer predicts class prob. and bb coordinates.
Multi-part loss function is assigned.

Inference
On PASCAL VOC network predicts 98 bounding boxes per image.
For each box class probabilities are predicted.
Only requires a single network evaluation, unlike classifier based methods. 

Limitation
Each grid cell can only have one class. Hence, prediction of nearby objects are limited.
Learning bounding boxes from a dataset limits network to generalize prediction to new or unusual aspect ratios or
configurations.
