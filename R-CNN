Two approaches are combined: localize and segment objects on the image + use domain specific fine tuning considering 
labeled training data is scarse.

Motivation: To what extent do the CNN classification results on ImageNet generalize to object detection results on the
PASCAL VOC Challenge?

Challenge1!

Detection requires localization. Possible solutions:

1. Regression (shown not much improvement via this method)
2. Sliding window (introduces technical challenge)

and preferred solution is "recognition using regions". Generate around 2000 proposals at test time, extract features 
by using CNNs from these proposals and perform classification on each region's feature map via linear SVMs. Regardless
of the region's shape, wrap it to a fixed size as an input to the CNN. 

Challenge2!

Training a CNN. It requires sufficient amount of labeled data. Possible solution:

1. Use unsupervised pre-tranied netword and perform supervised fine-tuning. (pedestrian detection)

and preferred solution is "using supervised pre-trained network on a large data (ILSVRC) and then perform domain specific
fine-tuning on a small dataset (PASCAL)"

MODULES of the DETECTION

1. Generating category-independent region proposals:
