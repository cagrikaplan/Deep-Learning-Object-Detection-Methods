Main direction is to efficiently classify object proposals by building on previous work R-CNN.

Challenges:
Numerous candidate object locations or proposals must be processed.
These candidates provide only rough localization that must be refined to achieve precise localization.

Motivation: single stage training algorithm that jointly learns to classify object proposals and refine their spatial 
locations.
