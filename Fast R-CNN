Main direction is to efficiently classify object proposals by building on previous work R-CNN.

Challenges:
Numerous candidate object locations or proposals must be processed.
These candidates provide only rough localization that must be refined to achieve precise localization.

Motivation: single stage training algorithm that jointly learns to classify object proposals and refine their spatial 
locations. 

Drawbacks of R-CNN:
1. Training is multi-stage pipeline= finetune conv net, fit SVMs to conv net features, regress bounding boxes.
2. Expensive training in terms of space and time: extracting features and training SVM, bounding box regressor 
for each proposal requires lots of disk space and time.
3. Slow detection on test time due to results mentioned above.

Drawbacks of SPPnet:
1. Multi-stage pipeline
2. Not possible to update conv layers preceding spatial pyramid pooling

Contributions:
1. Better mAP than R-CNN and SPPnet
2. Single-stage training with multi-task loss
3. All network layers are updateable
4. Feature catching does not require disk storage
