Motivation: Generate cost free region proposal via region proposal network (RPN) which shares full image conv features 
with the detection network. Then let RPN predict object bounds and objectness scores at each position.

Sharing conv at test time makes cost for computing proposals small. 

In a summary, on top of conv features, add two more conv layers (region proposal network). 
One encodes each conv map position into a short feature vector, e.g. 256-d,
Another outputs objectness score and regressed bounds for k region proposals relative to various scales and aspect ratios at
that location for each conv map position.

How RPNs work?
Basically, take an input image and output a set of rectangular object proposals and each of these rectangular proposals must 
have objectness score (object? or background?). To do so, slide a small network on the top of last feature map. Then sliding 
windows with different scales and aspect ratios maps this feature map to a lower dimensional vector which is later to be fed
into two sbling fully connected layers (box regression and box classification). Each sliding window location generates k 
region proposals. Regression layer predicts 4k outputs. Classification layer predicts 2k scores (object/not-object 
probabilities).
