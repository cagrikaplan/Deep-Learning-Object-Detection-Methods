Motivation: Generate cost free region proposal via region proposal network (RPN) which shares full image conv features 
with the detection network. Then let RPN predict object bounds and objectness scores at each position.

Sharing conv at test time makes cost for computing proposals small. 

In a summary, on top of conv features, add two more conv layers (region proposal network). 
One encodes each conv map position into a short feature vector, e.g. 256-d,
Another outputs objectness score and regressed bounds for k region proposals relative to various scales and aspect ratios at
that location for each conv map position.
